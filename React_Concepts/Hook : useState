useState is a hook that allows you to add state to functional components. 
State is like a variable that React "remembers" even when the function re-runs due to re-renders. 
It allows components to keep track of data that changes over time, like user input or a counter.

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Initializing state with 0

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
